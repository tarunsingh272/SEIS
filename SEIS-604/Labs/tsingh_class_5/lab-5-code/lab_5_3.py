# lab_5_3.py

# Implement the append() and index() methods for UnorderedList
# Use the UnorderedList class, imported form unorderedlist.py

# Note you will add your code here to H5-1, where you'll also implement
#   insert() and pop() methods, thus completing the DSP-3.27 Exercise

import unorderedlist

# Modify unorderedlist.py and add the two methods
# Then test it on your import class unorderedlist.UnorderedList

def main():
    # add your test code here
    pass

main()
